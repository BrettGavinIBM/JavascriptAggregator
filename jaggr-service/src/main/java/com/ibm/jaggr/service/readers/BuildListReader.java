 * occur in the list. The read method will block on a Future until its 
 * reader is available and then read the data from that reader until all 
 * the data has been read. It will then move on to the next Future in the 
 * list and do the same, until all the readers have been read from. When 
 * the last reader has no more data, then -1 is returned from the read
